## Design Integration

This project has been integrated with UI components from a Figma-generated Flutter design featuring:

### Visual Elements:

- **Color Scheme**: Orange-themed palette (#FC8520, #BA5A13, #FFF2DF)
- **Typography**: Inter font family with responsive sizing
- **Assets**: Background images and icons properly integrated
- **Responsive Design**: Figma-based responsive scaling system

### UI Components:

- Custom text fields with validation
- Branded submit buttons with loading states
- Flexible image view component
- Consistent spacing and styling

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: Flutter 3.8.1+
- **Backend**: Supabase (ready for integration)
- **State Management**: Provider
- **UI Components**: Custom widgets with Material Design
- **Authentication**: Supabase Auth (planned)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL via Supabase (planned)

## Authentication Flow

### Dual Login System:

- **Users**: Create accounts via signup screen
- **Admins**: Use predefined admin credentials
- **Route Logic**: Email-based detection for admin vs user dashboard routing
